Day 1:
Mohammed: Thoroughly study the provided parameters and configurations page to understand the significance of each parameter in the RISC-V design concerning power and performance.
Ali: Familiarize himself with the existing GitHub project and the Flask code provided.
Heidar: Go through the AutoML and MLjar-supervised documentation to understand its current implementation in the project.
Day 2:
Mohammed: Continue exploring the RISC-V CVA6 design, focusing on the benchmarks (Median, Dhrystone, MatMul) that will be used in the project.
Ali: Begin studying AutoML, focusing on the statistical and mathematical principles involved.
Heidar: Familiarize himself with RISC-V, focusing on the architecture and its importance in the project.
Day 3:
Mohammed: Begin correlating the RISC-V parameters with the benchmarks, and start brainstorming on how these parameters could be represented and used in the AutoML model.
Ali: Continue working on understanding the statistical math notions of AutoML.
Heidar: Explore the AutoKeras documentation and understand how it can be integrated into the existing project in place of MLjar-supervised.
Day 4:
Mohammed: Discuss with the team how the RISC-V parameters and configurations might influence the design of the AutoML model for predicting power and performance.
Ali: Start working on improving the styling of the Flask application using CSS and JavaScript.
Heidar: Familiarize himself with model registry concepts and start drafting a plan for its implementation.
Day 5:
Mohammed: Draft a document detailing the significance of RISC-V parameters in the project and share with the team.
Ali: Continue integrating the updated styling into the Flask application.
Heidar: Research on best practices for implementing a model registry and share findings with the team.
Day 6:
All: Team meeting to review the work done over the week, discuss challenges faced, and plan for the following week.
All: Review each other's findings, especially Mohammed's document on RISC-V parameters, and discuss how to integrate this understanding into the AutoML model design.
Day 7:
All: Documentation - update the project documentation on GitHub to reflect the changes and findings made during the week.
All: Prepare a report summarizing the weekâ€™s activities, learning, and the plan for the next week.
